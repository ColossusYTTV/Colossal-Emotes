IIDK emote wheel was becoming really popular, and it was programmed like complete garbage. So I decided to redo it with way more emotes.

# Install (PLEASE READ, YOU MIGHT GET BANNED)
### If you are using a mod menu or another mod that uses the bypass to disable your offline vrrig
Download the NOBYPASS dll. If you are using 2 mods that both use the bypass your game will crash.
